            <p>
                While we have implemented measures to help moderate responses on the platform, we cannot be held liable
                for any information provided by users or AI-generated content. The information available on Venture is

                Service. You acknowledge that you use Venture at your own risk and assume full responsibility for any
                consequences resulting from your actions based on the information obtained from Venture.
